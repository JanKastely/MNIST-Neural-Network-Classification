# MNIST-Neural-Network-Classification
Workflow:
1) Connecting the neural network to the training data train_images and train_labels. The network will then learn to associate images with the corresponding class labels.
2) Finally, we tell the network to make predictions for test_images and verify that these predictions match the corresponding class labels from test_labels.
3) This mesh consists of a sequence of two Dense layers. The second layer is a 10-way software layer.
4) In the compilation step, we convert a float32 array of the form (60000, 28*28) with values between 0 and 1
5) Image data preparation
6)Label the classes
7Now the network is ready to be trained. In Keras, it is done by calling the Fit method of the given network.
